A great problem solver; and whatever she was up to, she was always investing a load of effort and passion in it. She was incredibly fun to work with, always the life and soul of the office. She's picked up JavaScript incredibly quickly, and constantly coming up with new and interesting applications to build with her newly acquired skills. Any company would be lucky to have her - if I was looking for JS developers right now, I would take her immediately",
